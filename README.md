# Geo3D Streaming - visualisation of (very) large geological models meshes

This project aims to provide efficient streaming of large 3D geological models to the [Geo3D Web Viewer](https://geo3d.pgi.gov.pl/), a platform for visualizing complex geological structures directly within a web browser. As 3D models continue to grow in size and complexity, geologists need a seamless way to publish and explore them across desktop and mobile devices.

## Project Overview

The geological models we work with are continuously increasing in size, making it necessary to develop a robust solution for streaming these massive datasets without sacrificing performance. This project will explore existing methods for mesh streaming, and if needed, develop a new solution tailored specifically for the Geo3D viewer.

### Key Objectives:
- Stream large geological meshes efficiently to the Geo3D viewer.
- Ensure compatibility across desktop and mobile platforms.
- Investigate and implement existing streaming solutions, or develop a new method optimized for Geo3D.
  
## Potential Solutions

Currently, the most promising candidate for mesh streaming is the [Nexus](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/nexus) framework, which specializes in progressive streaming of large-scale 3D models. However, we will evaluate other solutions as well to determine the best fit for Geo3D's specific requirements.

### Why Nexus?
- Nexus provides adaptive streaming, allowing for real-time rendering of 3D models as they load progressively.
- It is designed to handle large-scale meshes efficiently, making it a strong contender for this project.

### Additional Considerations:
- Compatibility with geological data formats.
- Ease of integration with the Geo3D web viewer.
- Performance on various devices, including mobile phones and tablets.

## Future Plans
If none of the existing solutions meet our performance and usability needs, we may develop a custom streaming method, tailor-made for Geo3D, focusing on optimizing the viewer's performance and user experience.

## How to Get Involved
Contributions are welcome! Whether you have experience with 3D rendering, web development, or geological modeling, weâ€™d love to collaborate. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request to discuss ideas or improvements.
